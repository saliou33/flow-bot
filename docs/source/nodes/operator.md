# Operator Nodes

Two types of operator nodes are available:

- **If/Else**: Has two outcomes: one with a `check` and another as a default with a `check`. A `check` contains `{name: value: fn}`.
- **Switch**: Supports multiple outcomes with `check` and a default without `check`. Modify edge checks by hovering over edges and clicking the pencil icon.
